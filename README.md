Working with Remotes:

- remotes are hosted copies of repositories.

- remotes support decentralization by allowing others to download a full local copy of their file structure.

- "origin" in git is a nickname for the URL that was cloned to create a local repository.

- git's "pull" command fetches and automatically merges any updates that occurred after the last local merge.

- git's "fetch" command simply fetches the updates, and requires a manual merge.

- setting up upstream tracking allows pulls and pushes to operate without verbose commands


5 POINTS Working Locally:

-You work inside a local repository

-Changes must be staged before you commit

-A commit saves a snapshot

-Git lets you track the history of your work

-You can undo mistakes locally (git restore)
